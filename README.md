## Things to add:

- ~~search_google checks if directory exists before downloading~~

- make matplotlib fullscreen by default

- make matplot close automatically after several seconds

- re-instate spectrogram creation (should be simple enough, just gotta check past commits) 

- ~~fix while/for loop skipping~~
