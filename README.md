## Things to do:

- saving spectrogram, and cropping (save for preprocessing?)

- create all training data

- preprocessing should take only one column of pixels and normalize all of them, possibly 1 being green and 0 being blue

# Things completed:

- ~~search_google checks if directory exists before downloading~~

- ~~make matplotlib fullscreen by default~~

- ~~make matplot close automatically after several seconds~~

- ~~re-instate spectrogram creation (should be simple enough, just gotta check past commits)~~ 

- ~~fix while/for loop skipping~~

- ~~think about removing some of the types of chords possible. I don't even know how to do extended or augmented chords. Also, with how we set our system up, adding them in later is very easy.~~
